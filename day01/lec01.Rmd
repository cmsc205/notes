## Advice

- Look at your data
- Don't thrash
- Do the most braindead thing first, take it end to end, then iterate/improve.
- "You actually donâ€™t know what you are doing until after you have done it."
- Think of the marginal return of your efforts.

*From Albert Kim's presentation on teaching data science to undergrads*
