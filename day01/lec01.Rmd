## What is Data Science?

## Data Pipeline

How does one answer a scientific question with data? Leek & Peng in Nature (2015) illustrate the [data pipeline](http://www.nature.com/news/statistics-p-values-are-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg-1.17412#/pipe)

1. Data collection
2. Data cleaning
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Statistical modelling
5. Inference (form conclusions and communicate them)

Intro stats classes focus a bit on 3, 4, and 5 partially. This class will try to cover all aspects of the pipeline.

## Advice

- Look at your data
- Don't thrash
- Do the most braindead thing first, take it end to end, then iterate/improve.
- "You actually donâ€™t know what you are doing until after you have done it."
- Think of the marginal return of your efforts.
