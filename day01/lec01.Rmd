## Advice for this course

- You are going to get frustrated, you're learning a new language
    + "You actually don't know what you are doing until after you have done it."
    
- Look at your data

- Don't be stuck for more than 20 minutes. This takes self-awareness and mindfulness.  Think of the marginal return of your efforts.

- Do the most braindead thing first, take it end to end, then iterate/improve.
