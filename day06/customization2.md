# Assignment

1. You will work with a partner to write a short blog post that contains (at least) one data graphic. Your goal is to tell the class something interesting using a well-crafted, thoughtfully-prepared data graphic. One data graphic should suffice, but you may include more if you choose.

2. Give a lightning talk (~ 5 min) summarizing the main point(s) of your blog post.

# Things to think about

- What point are you trying to make?
- What variable(s) is/are important to your?
- What visualization(s) will help you make that point
effectively?

  + `Lahman`: comprehensive historical archive of major league baseball data
  + `fueleconomy`: fuel economy data from the EPA, 1985â€“2015
