# What makes a good visualization?

---

# Tufte's graphical excellence...

- ...is the well designed presentation of interesting data - a matter of substance,
of statistics and of design.

- ...consists of complex data communicated with clarity, precision and efficiency.

- ...is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest
time with the least ink in the smallest space.

- ...is nearly always multivariate.

- ...requires telling the truth about the data.

# Ross Ihaka's three principles

- If the "story" is simple, keep it simple.

- If the "story" is complex, make it look simple.

- Tell the truth.
