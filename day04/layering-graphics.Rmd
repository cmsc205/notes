## Motivating example

Today, we hope to recreate the below graphic that appeared in the [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) article ["How to Tell Someoneâ€™s Age When All You Know Is Her Name"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-tell-someones-age-when-all-you-know-is-her-name/).

The data we will use today are found on [GitHub]().


![](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/silver-feature-joseph2.png?quality=90&strip=all&w=1150&ssl=1)

## Step 1: Load the tidyverse and the data


## Step 2: Filter out the Josephs


## Step 3: Draw a bar chart on top for Josephs who are alive


## Step 4: Draw the line plot for all Josephs


## Step 5: Tweaking the colors and line width


## Step 6: Highlighting the median age

Don't forget to install `Hmisc`!

```{r}
library(Hmisc) # to access wtd.quantile() function

median_year <- wtd.quantile(x = joseph$year, weights = joseph$est_alive_today, probs = 0.5)
median_year
```


## Step 7: Fixing the axis labels


## Step 8: Adding a title


## Step 9: Adding text annotations


## Step 10: Changing the theme

When creating publication-quality graphics, we often want to change the **theme** of the plot. That is, we might not want a gray background, or we may which to change the tick marks on the axis, or some other characteristic. This type of change is a change to the theme. Today, we'll use the `ggthemes` package to quickly make a change to a different theme.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggthemes) # contains numerous different themes
```

You can find a gallery of the available themes [here](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes)
