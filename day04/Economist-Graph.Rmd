The *Economist* is a well-regarded weekly news magazine.  The following graphic accompanied their article about the release of the "College Scorecard" data in Sept. 2015.

**Your task** is to reproduce this graph from the College Scorecard data, and perhaps enhance it.

# The data

The Scorecard data is too voluminous to work with conveniently in class; it takes too long to download.  You'll be working with a subset available in the file `ScorecardSmallNarrow.csv` which contains a single data table that is ready for plotting. After loading the `tidyverse` package, you can read this data set in using the below command:

```{r echo=FALSE}
scorecard <- read_csv("ScorecardSmallNarrow.csv")
```

Note that both in the graph and the data set the case (i.e. row) is a level of family income at an institution. In all there are 8964 cases and 5 variables:

1. `CONTROL`: public (1) or private (2) institution. 
#. `ADM_RATE`: admissions rate in percent
#. `income_group`: income quintile
#. `net_cost`: average net cost for students

```{r echo= params$show_answers, eval=params$show_answers, message=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
scorecard %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=net_cost)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color="blue") + 
  facet_grid(CONTROL ~ income_group) +
  geom_smooth(color="red") + 
  ylim(0, 50000) +
  xlab("Admissions rate, %") +
  ylab("Net cost per year, $'000") 
```
