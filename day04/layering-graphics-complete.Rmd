## Motivating example

Today, we hope to recreate the below graphic that appeared in the [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) article ["How to Tell Someoneâ€™s Age When All You Know Is Her Name"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-tell-someones-age-when-all-you-know-is-her-name/).

The data we will use today are found on [GitHub]().

## Step 1: Load the tidyverse and the data

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(mdsr)
babynames <- make_babynames_dist()
head(babynames)
```


## Step 2: Filter out the Josephs

```{r}
joseph <- filter(babynames, name == "Joseph" & sex == "M")
```

## Step 3: Draw a bar chart on top for Josephs who are alive

```{r}
name_plot <- 
  ggplot(joseph, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(y = count_thousands * alive_prob))
name_plot
```

## Step 4: Draw the line plot for all Josephs

```{r}
name_plot <- 
  name_plot +
  geom_line(aes(y = count_thousands)) 
name_plot
```

## Step 5: Tweaking the colors and line width

```{r}
name_plot <- 
  ggplot(joseph, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(x = year, y = count_thousands * alive_prob), fill = "skyblue", color = "white") +
  geom_line(aes(y = count_thousands), size = 1)
name_plot
```


## Step 6: Highlighting the median age

```{r}
library(Hmisc) # to access wtd.quantile() function

median_year <- wtd.quantile(x = joseph$year, weights = joseph$est_alive_today, probs = 0.5)
median_year

median_year_alive <- filter(joseph, year == median_year)
```

```{r}
name_plot <- 
  name_plot +
   geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "white", fill = "dodgerblue3", aes(y = ifelse(year == median_year, count_thousands * alive_prob, NA)))
name_plot
```


## Step 7: Fixing the axis labels

```{r}
name_plot <- 
  name_plot +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Number of people (thousands)")
name_plot
```

## Step 8: Adding a title

```{r}
name_plot <- 
  name_plot +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution of American Boys Named Joseph",
       subtitle = "By year of birth")
name_plot
```


## Step 9: Adding text annotations

```{r}
name_plot <- 
  name_plot + 
  ylim(0, 43) +
  geom_text(x = 1935, y = 40, label = "Number of Josephs\nborn each year") +
  geom_text(x = 1915, y = 13, label = "Number of Josephs\nborn each year\nestimated to be alive\non 1/1/2014", color = "skyblue") +
  geom_text(x = 2003, y = 40, label = "The median\nliving Joseph\nis 37 years old", color = "darkgray") +
  geom_curve(x = 1995, xend = 1975, y = 40, yend = 24, 
             arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm")),
             curvature = 0.5)
name_plot
```

## Step 10: Changing the theme

When creating publication-quality graphics, we often want to change the **theme** of the plot. That is, we might not want a gray background, or we may which to change the tick marks on the axis, or some other characteristic. This type of change is a change to the theme. Today, we'll use the `ggthemes` package to quickly make a change to a different theme.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggthemes) # contains numerous different themes
```

You can find a gallery of the available themes [here](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes)

```{r}
name_plot + theme_minimal()
```
