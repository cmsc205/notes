## Your turn

Using the `babynames` data set in the `babynames` package, modify Testing.Rmd so that we can

- type in a name
- specify a range of years

and get a time series plot of the proportions of babies with the specified name for both sexes for the specified range of years.

## Advice

This is a <font color="dodgerblue">software engineering</font> project. There are best practices for such things:

- <font color="dodgerblue">Start simple</font>: get the simplest possible version of your project working
- <font color="dodgerblue">Then Iterate</font>: then slowly start adding components, testing often, until you can what you want.
- Don't try to get it perfect from the beginning!

## Your turn

Using the `sf2016` data set from 2/6, create a shiny app to run a one-sample bootstrap. Specifically, we should be able to

- specify a sample size with a slider
- select `Salaries` or `TotalCompensation` from a drop-down menu

and get a histogram of the bootstrap distribution for the mean.
